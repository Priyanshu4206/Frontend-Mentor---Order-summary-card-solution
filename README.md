Working with this project made me realize what's the true meaning of learning by working.
While working on this project I learned concepts like :-

- dividing and conquer technique
- Flexbox properties 
- Resposive Design of Website 
- positioning of div to the centre of the screen
- Working with pattern design  was new to me this time

### Continued development

- During this project I learned a lot about responsive designs and hope to refine that in my upcoming projects.
- While working with images properties and adjusting the width and height properties of it for being resposive is one part of skill I really need to work upon.
- This time the tough part was to work upone the responsive design and it really requires good understanding of concepts.So thats what my focus will be.
